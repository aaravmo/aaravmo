Hi! I'm Aarav, a machine learning researcher, software developer, and undergraduate student at USC. Besides the projects visible in my github, you can find some other stuff I've worked on here:

[Multimodal Speech Recognition for Language-guided Embodied Agents (Interspeech 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14030)

SEMPI: A Database for Understanding Social Engagement in Video-Mediated Multiparty Interaction (ICMI 2024)

[Lung Manifestations of COVID-19 on Chest Radiographs (Springer Nature Medical - 2021)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787585/)
